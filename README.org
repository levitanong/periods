#+TITLE: Periods

A small time period (e.g. 4 months, 3 hours, 2 minutes) library determined NOT
to work on date-times. I repeat, this is not a date-time library.

* Installation

#+begin_src
[com.levitanong/periods "0.0.2"]
#+end_src

* Usage

From this point forward, it is assumed that your require statement looks like this
#+begin_src clojure
(require '[periods.core :as periods])
#+end_src

** Periods are just hash maps.
#+begin_src clojure
{:hours 25}
#+end_src

** The keys are unabbreviated and plural.
#+begin_src clojure
(def period-units
  [:years :months :days :hours :minutes :seconds :milliseconds])
#+end_src

** Normalize periods to be proper.
#+begin_src clojure
(periods/normalize {:hours 25}) ;; {:days 1, :hours 1}
#+end_src

** 365.25 days a year
That 0.25 refers to leap years. This means there are 30.4375 days in a month on
average.
#+begin_src clojure
(periods/normalize-milliseconds {:milliseconds 66571200000})
;; {:years 2 :months 1 :days 9 :hours 13 :minutes 30}
#+end_src
